Data Format
===========

The Universal Binary JSON specification utilizes a single binary tuple to
represent all JSON data types (both value and container types)::

  <type, 1-byte char>[<length, 1 or 4-byte integer>][<data>]

Each element in the tuple is defined as:

* **type**

  * A 1-byte ASCII char used to indicate the type of the data following it.
  * A single ASCII char was chosen to make manually walking and debugging
    data stored in the Universal Binary JSON format as easy as possible
    (e.g. making the data relatively readable in a hex editor).
* **length** (OPTIONAL)
  1-byte or 4-byte length value based on the type specified. This allows
  for more aggressive compression and space-optimization when dealing with
  a lot of small values.

  * 1-byte: An unsigned byte value (``0`` to ``254``) used to indicate the
    length of the data payload following it. Useful for small items.
  * 4-byte: An unsigned integer value (``0`` to ``2,147,483,647``) used to
    indicate the length of the data payload following it. Useful for larger
    items.
* **data** (OPTIONAL)
  A run of bytes representing the actual binary data for this type of value.

In the name of efficiency, the length and data fields are optional depending on
the type of value being encoded. Some value are simple enough that just writing
the 1-byte ASCII marker into the stream is enough to represent the value
(e.g. `null`) while others have a type that is specific enough that no length is
needed as the length is implied by the type (e.g. `int32`).

The specifics of each data type will be spelled out down below for more clarity.

The basic organization provided by this tuple (`type-length-data`) allows each
JSON construct to be represented in a binary format that is simple to read and
write without the need for complex/custom encodings or ``null``-termating bytes
anywhere in the stream that has to be scanned for or references resolved.

.. _value_types:

Value Types
===========

This section describes the mapping between the 5 discrete value types from the
JSON specification into the Universal Binary JSON format.

JSON
----

The JSON specification defines 7 value types:

* string
* number
* object (container)
* array (container)
* true
* false
* null

Of those 7 values, 2 of them are types describing containers that hold the 5
basic values. We have a separate section below for looking at the 2 container
types specifically, so for the time being let’s only consider the following 5
discrete value types:

* string
* number
* true
* false
* null

Most of these types have a ``1:1`` mapping to a primitive type in most popular
programming languages (Java, C, Python, PHP, Erlang, etc.) except for `number`.
This makes defining the types for the 4 easy, but let’s take a closer look at
how we might deconstruct `number` into its core representations.

Number Type
^^^^^^^^^^^

In JavaScript, the `Number`_ type can represent any numeric value where as many
other languages define numbers using 3-6 discrete numeric types depending on the
type and length of the value being stored. This allows the runtime to handle
numeric operations more efficiently.

In order for the Universal Binary JSON specification to be a performant
alternative to JSON, support for these most common numeric types had to be added
to allow for more efficient reading and writing of numeric values.

`number` is deconstructed in the Universal Binary JSON specification and defined
by the following **signed** numeric types:

* byte (8-bits, 1-byte)
* int16 (16-bits, 2-bytes)
* int32 (32-bits, 4-bytes)
* int64 (64-bits, 8-bytes)
* float (32-bits, 4-bytes)
* double (64-bits, 8-bytes)
* huge (arbitrarily long, UTF-8 string-encoded numeric value)

Trying to maintain a single `number` type represented in binary form would have
lead to parsing complexity and slow-downs as the processing language would have
to further inspect the value and map it to the most optimal type.
By pre-defining these different numeric types directly in binary, in most
languages the number can stay in their optimal form on disk and be deserialized
back into their native representation with very little overhead.

When working on a platform like JavaScript that has a singular type for numbers,
all of these data types (with the exception of `huge`) can simply be mapped back
to the `number` type with ease and no loss of precision.

When converting these formats back to JSON, all of the numeric types can simply
be rendered as the singular number type defined by the JSON spec without issue;
there is total compatibility!

Value Type Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we have clearly defined all of our (signed) numeric types and mapped
the 4 remaining simple types to Universal Binary JSON, we have our final list of
discrete value types:

* null
* false
* true
* byte
* int16
* int32
* int64
* float
* double
* huge
* string

Now that we have defined all the types we need, let’s see how these are actually
represented in binary in the next section.

Universal Binary JSON
---------------------

The Universal Binary JSON specification defines a total of 13 discrete value
types (that we saw in the last section) all delimited in the binary file by a
specific, 1-byte ASCII character (optionally) followed by a length and
(optionally) a data payload containing the value data itself.

Some of the values (`null`, `true`` and `false`) are specific enough that
the single 1-byte ASCII character is enough to represent the value in the format
and they will have no `length` or `data` section.

All of the numeric values (except `huge`) automatically imply a length by
virtue of the type of number they are. For example, a 4-byte `int32` always
has a length of 4-bytes; an 8-byte `double` always requires 8 bytes of data.

In these cases the ASCII marker for these types are immediately followed by the
data representing the number with no `length` value in between.

Because `string` and `huge` are potentially variable length, they contain all 3
elements of the tuple: `type-length-data`.

This table shows the official definitions of the discrete value types:

+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+
|       Type      |           Size           | Marker | Length? |     Data?    |

+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+

.. note::

  The duplicate (lowercased) ``h`` and ``s`` types are just versions of those
  types that allow for a 1-byte length (instead of 4-byte length) to be used for
  more compact storage when length is ``<= 254``.

With each field of the table described as:

* **Type**

  * The binary value data type defined by the spec.

* **Size**

  * The byte-size of the construct, as stored in the binary format. This is not
    the value of the `length` field, just an indicator to you (the reader) of
    approximately how much space writing out a value of this type will take.

* **Marker**

  * The single ASCII character marker used to delimit the different types of
    values in the binary format. When reading in bytes from a file stored in
    this format, you can simply check the decimal value of the byte
    (e.g. ``'A' = 65``) and switch on that value for processing.

* **Length?**

  * Indicates if the data type provides a length value between the ASCII marker
    and the data payload.
  * Many of the data types represented in the binary format either don’t have a
    length (`null`, `true` or `false`) or their types (e.g. the numeric
    values) are specific enough that the length is implied.
  * When specifying the length for a string or huge value (UTF-8 encoded), the
    length **must represent the number of bytes** of the UTF-8 string and not
    the number of characters in the string.

  .. note::

    For example, English typically uses 1-byte per character, so the string
    “hello” has a length of 5. The same string in Russian is “привет” with a
    byte length of 12 and in Arabic the text becomes “مرحبا” with a byte length
    of 10.

* **Data?**

  * Indicates if the data type provides a data payload representing the value.
  * Most types except for `null`, `true` and `false` provide a data payload
    indicating their value.
  * Variable-length types like `string` and `huge` **do not** provide a data
    payload when they are empty (i.e. length of 0).More specifically, if you are
    writing a parser for the Universal Binary JSON format and you encounter a
    `string` of length 0, you know the very next byte is an ASCII marker for
    another value since the `string` has no data payload.

.. note::

  **Using Numeric Types**

  It is always recommended to use the smallest numeric type that fits your
  needs. For data with a large amount of numeric data, this can cut down the
  size of the payloads significantly (on average a **50% reduction in size**).

  All numeric types are **signed**.

  Numeric values of `infinity` are encoded as a `null` (``Z``) value.
  (See `ECMA`_, See `JSON presentation`_)

  **64-bit Integers**

  While almost all languages native support 64-bit integers, not all do
  (e.g. C89 and JavaScript (`yet`_)) and care must be taken when encoding 64-bit
  integer values into binary JSON then attempting to decode it on a platform
  that doesn't support it.

  If you are fully aware of the platforms and runtime environments your binary
  JSON is being used on and know they all support 64-bit integers, then you are
  fine.

  If you are trying to deserialize 64-bit integers in a client’s browser in
  JavaScript or another environment that does not support 64-bit integers, then
  you will want to take care to skip them in the input or have the client
  producing them encode them as `double` or `huge` values if that is easier to
  handle.

  Alternatively you might consider encoding your 64-bit values as doubles if you
  know you are going from the server to a client JavaScript environment with the
  binary-encoded information.

  **32-bit Floats**

  All 32-bit float values are written into the binary format using the
  `IEEE 754 single precision floating point format`_, which is the following
  structure:

  * Bit 31 (1 bit) – sign
  * Bit 30-23 (8 bits) – exponent
  * Bit 22-0 (23 bits) – fraction (significand)

  **64-bit Doubles**

  All 64-bit double values are written into the binary format using the
  `IEEE 754 double precision floating point format`_, which is the following
  structure:

  * Bit 63 (1 bit) – sign
  * Bit 62-52 (11 bits) – exponent
  * Bit 51-0 (52 bits) – fraction (significand)

  **huge Numeric Type**

  The huge numeric type is a safe and portable way for representing
  **values > 64-bit** by way of an UTF-8 encoded string. The format of this
  string **must adhere** to the `JSON number specification`_.

  This allows `huge` numbers to be portable across all platforms and easily
  converted to/from JSON as well as more robust handling on platforms that may
  not support arbitrarily large numbers.

  If you are working on a platform that has no support for huge numbers, please
  see our :ref:`Best Practices <best_practices>` recommendation on how to handle
  them.

  It is considered a violation of this specification to store numeric
  **values <= 64-bit** as a `huge`.

  This decision was made in order to simplify the parsing logic required to
  process the Universal Binary JSON specification; there is no need to
  introspect `huge` values to see if they contain smaller numeric values when
  mapping UBJSON types to native types of the runtime environment.

  The `huge` type should only be used when you need to (safely and portably)
  represent **values > 64-bit**.

  **UTF-8 Encoding**

  The JSON specification does not dictate a specific required encoding, it does
  however use UTF-8 as the default encoding.

  The Universal Binary JSON specification dictates `UTF-8`_ as the
  **required string encoding**. This will allow you to easily exchange binary
  JSON between open systems that all follow this encoding requirement.

  Fortunately, this is ideal for `a multitude of reasons`_ like space efficiency
  and compatibility across systems and alternative formats.

To further clarify the binary layout of these data types, below are some visual
examples of what the bytes would look like inside of a binary JSON file.

NOTE: ``[ ]``-block notation is used for readability, the ``[ ]`` characters
**are not** actually written out in the binary format.

+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``[s][4][name][s][3][bob]``      |  6 + 5 bytes, equivalent of “name”: “bob” |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Now that we have seen how the JSON data value types map to the binary format,
in the next section we will see how we can combine these values together into
the two container types (objects and arrays) to create complex object
hierarchies using the Universal Binary JSON format.

.. _container_types:

Container Types
===============

In this section we will look at the 2 remaining JSON value types that we are
referring to as “container types”, namely object and array.

JSON
----

The two JSON container types are described as follows:

* **object**

  * A construct containing 0 or more name-value pairings, where the name is
    always a string and the value can be any valid value type including
    container types themselves.

* **array**

  * A flat list of values only, where the values can by any valid value type
    including container types themselves.
  * The JSON specification does not make it a requirement that the values in an
    array are all of the same type and neither does the Universal Binary JSON
    specification.

.. note::
   **Advanced**: This can actually be to your benefit. Take for example an array
   of `int64` values, as you are writing them out to a file or a stream, you can
   check the actual value of each `int64` and depending on the value, encode
   each one into the smallest possible numeric type (e.g. `byte`, `int32`, etc.).

   This can lead to a significant size reduction (say **50% smaller**) in
   smaller numeric values!

Given these two constructs, let’s see how they are modeled in the Universal
Binary JSON format.

Universal Binary JSON
---------------------

The two container types defined by JSON are modeled using the same tuple that
defines all of our other data structures in this specification so far with a
minor modification: the length value is considered a count of the child elements
the container holds. It does not mean the byte length of the child elements.

.. note::
  Exactly what *child element* means depends on the container. In an `object`, a
  single child element is a name-value pair; in an `array`, a child element is a
  single value.

More specifically, the tuple stays exactly the same, it is just the meaning of
the center `length` element that changes::

  <type, 1-byte char>[<length, 1 or 4-byte integer>][<data>]

All the code used to process the constructs defined by this specification stays
the same, but when an `object` or `array` construct are encountered, the code
needs to be aware that the `length` value is the **child element count** so it
can know when the scope of the container ends.

For example, if you have an object that contains 4 arrays of `length` 50, the
`length` argument for the object is 4 (because it contains the four arrays)
while the `length` argument for each array is 50 (because they each hold
50 elements).

.. note::
  Unknown-length container types are also supported by the Universal Binary JSON
  specification and are covered in detail in the :ref:`Streaming <streaming>`
  section of this document.

Additionally, the only optional field in the tuple for container types is
`data`, if the container is empty and contains no elements
(i.e. the `length` is 0) then there is no `data` segment.

All together, the definitions for the `object` and `array` container types looks
like this:

+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+
|       Type      |           Size           | Marker | Length? |     Data?    |
+=================+==========================+========+=========+==============+
| array           | 2-bytes                  | a      | Yes     | Yes,         |
|                 | + byte length of string  |        |         | if non-empty |
+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+
| array           | 5-bytes                  | A      | Yes     | Yes,         |
|                 | + byte length of string  |        |         | if non-empty |
+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+
| object          | 2-bytes                  | o      | Yes     | Yes          |
|                 | + byte length of string  |        |         | if non-empty |
+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+
| object          | 5-bytes                  | O      | Yes     | Yes,         |
|                 | + byte length of string  |        |         | if non-empty |
+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+

.. note::
  `array` and `object` can also be specified in a more compact manner using
  1-byte for the `length` when it is ``<= 254``. Specifying a `length` of
  ``255`` for the 1-byte variants has a special meaning of **length unknown**
  and is covered in more detail in the :ref:`Streaming <streaming>` section of
  the spec.

The details for each field are the same as described for the non-container
values in the previous section with the one caveat that `length` is a count of
child elements and **not** the number of bytes representing the contents of the
container.

Let’s look at a quick example of encoding an object, again using the handy
``[ ]``-notation we used before simply for readability (the ``[ ]`` chars are
not written out or part of the file format).

Consider the following JSON (30-bytes compacted)::

  {
      "id": 1234567890,
      "name": "bob"
  }

Storing that object in the Universal Binary JSON format would look like this
(whitespace added for readability)::

  [o][2] 2 bytes
    [s][2][id][I][1234567890] 4 + 5 = 9 bytes
    [s][4][name][s][3][bob]   6 + 5 = 11 bytes

Our Universal Binary JSON format is 22 bytes, **27% smaller** than our compacted
JSON!

Walking through our example above, using a word-journey this is what a parser might see and do:

#. I see an ``o``, so I know I am parsing an `object` and that the next byte is
   the `length` (or count) for this object.
#. I see a ``2``, so I know the object contains 2 elements that I must account
   for to know when the `object` scope is closed (because we don’t use the
   ``{ }`` brackets like JSON).
#. I see an ``s``, knowing how the name-value pairings inside of an object work,
   I know this is the `name` portion of some upcoming value.
#. I see an ``I``, I know this is an `int32` value and that it belongs to the
   `name` I parsed in the previous step.
#. I see another ``s``, I know this is a new name-value pair and this is the
   `name` portion.
#. I see another ``s`` and know this is the value belonging to the `name` I just
   processed.
#. I have just parsed 2 values, so now I know the `object` scope is closed.

Encoding objects containing other `objects` would work identically except we would
have encountered another ``o`` or ``O`` marker and descended a level further
into a new object.

Let’s look at another example, this time a simple JSON array construct
(remember, they only contain values and not name-value pairs like `objects`).

This array is 48-bytes in compacted JSON::

  [
    null,
    true,
    false,
    4782345193,
    153.132417549,
    "ham"
  ]

Storing the array in the Universal Binary JSON format would look like this
(whitespace added for readability)::

  [a][6] - 2 bytes
     [Z] - 1 byte
     [T] - 1 byte
     [F] - 1 byte
     [I][4782345193] - 5 bytes
     [D][153.132417549] - 9 bytes
     [s][3][ham] - 5 bytes

Our Universal Binary JSON format is 24 bytes or **50% smaller** than the
compacted JSON!

Because the container types specify their total child element count, it is
easier and faster for parsers to know when the scope of a container has closed
or is still open waiting for more children (e.g. in the case of streaming over
the network). This is not unlike the high-performance `Redis protocol`_.

This also has the added benefit of not needing any terminating values in the
binary that need to be scanned for to know when a container-scope is closed.
This way data can be read in chunks and not read-and-scanned byte-by-byte.

As was mentioned previously though, there are some cases where having an
unbounded container are important (for example, streaming content from a server
as it generates it on-the-fly).

In the next section we will take a look at the Universal Binary JSON constructs
that are optimized for streaming. Fortunately, there are only 3 and they are
just as easy as the constructs we have covered so far!


.. _streaming:

Streaming Types
===============

The Universal Binary JSON specification is optimized for fast read-speed by
prefixing the byte-length of every construct to the front of it, this allows
parsers to digest entire chunks of the data stream at a time without scanning
for terminating byte values.

Unfortunately, this model of data becomes very expensive (and sometimes
impossible) to adhere to in a streaming-friendly environment where a server may
be generating `UBJ` formatted data on-the-fly and streaming it back in real time
to the client.

If the server had to adhere to the prefixed-length requirement of this
specification up until now, it would have to generate, buffer and count all the
elements in its reply before writing out the Universal Binary JSON so it could
correctly prefix the lengths to all the containers.

In this section of the specification we look at 1 new additional type to the
Universal Binary JSON specification that compliments our streaming scenario and
then two minor changes to the existing **container types** to enable easy and
efficient streaming with unknown-length support for our `array` and `object`
containers.

.. _noop:

No-Op Type
----------

The noop value stands for `No Op` or `No Operation`, it is a specific value
(like ``Z`` for `null`, ``T`` for `true` and ``F`` for `false`) that is useful
in streaming scenarios where an acknowledge of life needs to be sent between two
end points, but the confirmation being sent cannot change the meaning of the
data it is sent within.

The most common use for such a value type is as a `keep-alive` signal from a
server to the client; letting the client know the server is possibly operating
on a long-running job and is still alive, but just isn’t ready to send more data
yet.

The `noop` type is defined as follows:

+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+
|       Type      |           Size           | Marker | Length? |     Data?    |
+=================+==========================+========+=========+==============+
| noop            | 1-byte                   | N      | No      | No           |
+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+

Any parser code written to load the Universal Binary Spec needs to be aware that
encountering the ``N`` marker in files of any kind is valid and is merely useful
as a signal mechanism from producer to consumer to say “Hey, I am still alive.”,
the marker is intended to be safely ignored if the server or client doesn’t need
the acknowledgement.

In order for this keep-alive-esque construct to work, the specification had to
define a single byte value that had no meaning for the server and client to
exchange if needed, but caused no modification to the meaning of the data that
they are exchanging.

In code that handles streaming from a server, your handler for the `noop` type
might just reset a disconnect timer. In code that handles UBJ files, you would
simply ignore the noop marker when you encountered it in the file because it
would mean nothing.

.. warning::

  The `noop` type is only defined to be used inside of an
  :ref:`unknown-length container <unsized_container>`. If you have a
  container that clearly defines a child element count (`length`) it should not
  contain a `noop` marker element.

  Also, the `noop` type **should never** be sent inside of a value (e.g.
  embedded inside of a `string` being streamed); it must only be written to the
  stream between declared values.

If your interaction with the Universal Binary JSON format is primarily as a file
format, it is likely that you may never need to use the `noop` type; its value
becomes more apparent in long-lived, client-server, data-streaming scenarios.

.. _unsized_container:

Unknown-Length Containers
-------------------------

The Universal Binary JSON specification supports containers (`array` and
`object`) of unknown length to be specified when the producer of the binary data
cannot (efficiently) know in advance how many elements it is going to write out.

In these cases, the lowercased, 1-byte-length versions of array or object must
be used (``a`` or ``o`` markers) with a length value of ``0xFF`` (255) as well
as specifying an ``E`` terminator character after the last element in the
container.

The ``E`` type used to delimit the end of unknown-length containers is defined as
follows:

+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+
|       Type      |           Size           | Marker | Length? |     Data?    |
+=================+==========================+========+=========+==============+
| end             | 1-byte                   | E      | No      | No           |
+-----------------+--------------------------+--------+---------+--------------+

.. warning::

  Using a length of ``0xFF`` with the uppercase, 4-byte-length versions of array
  (``A``) and object (``O``) is not valid according to this specification.
  You must use the 1-byte-length variants of the container types when specifying
  an unknown `length`.

An example would look like this::

  [a][255]
     [S][3][bob]
     [I][1024]
     [T]
     [F]
     [S][4][ham!]
  [E]

The three key elements being the lowercased ``a`` marker, the length of ``0xFF``
(255) and the ``E`` marker at the end of the container.

Another example might look like this::

  [o][255]
     [B][4]
     [D][21.786]
     [N]
     [Z]
     [h][27][131.098412283059e2371293452]
  [E]

You might notice in the example above we injected a `noop` instruction right in
the middle, before the `null`. As mentioned in the :ref:`No-Op Type <noop>`
section, this is valid and can occur at any time while parsing the contents of
an `unknown-length` container.

If your parser has no need for recognizing the `noop` code (e.g. listening for
a keep-alive) then it can just be safely ignored and parsing continued
(hence the name “no-op”). It is up to the implementation to decide what to do
with the `noop` type.

You might be wondering how using a 1-byte ``E`` as a terminator to an unbounded
container can work and not get confused with say another ``E`` inside of a
`string`, the reason this works is because none of the discrete value types
(numeric, string, etc.) are of unknown `length`.

The lengths of all the values contained inside of the container are known and
must be read completely, doing so will guarantee that the ``E`` is only ever
encountered by itself as an element marker which is easily handled by parsing
code to know the scope of the container has been closed.


.. _size:

Size Requirements
=================

The Universal Binary JSON specification tries to strike the perfect balance
between space savings, simplicity and performance.

Data stored using the Universal Binary JSON format are on average
**30% smaller** as a rule of thumb. As you can see from some of the examples in
this document though, it is not uncommon to see the binary representation of
some data lead to a **50% or 60% reduction in size**.

The size reduction of your data depends heavily on the type of data you are
storing. It is best to do your own benchmarking with a comprehensive sampling
of your own data.

.. warning::

  The Universal Binary JSON specification does not use compression algorithms to
  achieve smaller storage sizes. The size reduction is a side effect of the
  efficient binary storage format.

Size Reduction Tips
-------------------

The amount of storage size reduction you’ll experience with the Universal Binary
JSON format will depend heavily on the type of data you are encoding.

Some data shrinks considerably, some mildly and some not at all, but in every
case your data will be stored in a much more efficient format that is faster to
read and write.

Below are pointers to give you an idea of how certain data may shrink in this
format:

* `null`, `true` and `false` values will compress 75%
  (80% in the case of `false`)
* large `numeric` values (> 5 digits < 20 digits) will compress on average 50%.
* `string` values
  * of length <= 254 stay the same size.
  * of length > 254 are 3-bytes bigger per string.
* `object` and `array` values compress 1-byte-per-element.

One of the great things about the Universal Binary JSON format is that even
though most all your data will be represented in a smaller footprint, you still
get two big wins:

#. A smaller data format means faster writes and smaller reads. It also means
   less data to process when parsing.
#. Binary format means no encoding/decoding primitive values to text and no
   parsing primitive values from text.

Endianness
==========

The Universal Binary JSON specification requires that all numeric values be
written in `Big-Endian`_ order.

MIME Type
=========

The Universal Binary JSON specification is a binary format and recommends using
the following mime type::

  application/x-ubjson

This was added directly to the specification in hopes of avoiding
`similar confusion with JSON`_.

File Extension
==============

``ubj`` is the `recommended file extension`_ when writing out files using the
Universal Binary JSON format (e.g. ``user.ubj``).

The extension stands for `“Universal Binary JSON”` and has no known conflicting
mappings to other file formats.


.. _best_practices:

Best Practices
==============

Through work with the community, feedback from others and our own experience
with the specification, below are some of the best-practices collected into one
place making it easy for folks working with the format to find answers to the
more flexible portions of the spec.

Handling `huge` Numbers
-----------------------

Not every language supports arbitrarily long numbers greater than 64-bits
(represented by the `huge` data type), but many do.

If you are writing a library to read/write Universal Binary JSON and the
platform you are working with does not support them, we recommend throwing an
exception or returning an error to the caller, letting them know unsupported
data is contained in the file they are trying to parse.

If the library you are writing is meant to be a general-purpose parser and needs
to be more resilient than that, we recommend the following:

#. Make the default behavior to throw an exception or return an error when the
   unsupported huge data type is encountered.
#. Provide an optional behavior to the parser (that must be specifically enabled
   by the caller) that treats the huge value as a simple string and returns it
   to the caller to handle (e.g. insert in a database) if they need it.
#. Provide an optional behavior to the parser (again, that must be specifically
   enabled by the caller) to simply skip unsupported values.

This implementation should give the user the most functional experience working
with your library and the Universal Binary JSON format while making it clear on
their particular platform some data types could cause trouble; this is preferred
to making the default operation to ignore the unsupported values.
